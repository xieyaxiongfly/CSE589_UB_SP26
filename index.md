## Course Information

**Lecture Time:** Tuesday & Thursday, 5:00 PM - 6:20 PM  
**Location:** Knox Hall, 110, North Campus  
**Semester:** Spring 2026  

## Course Description
This course introduces the principles and practice of computer networking through a two-axis progression: from small, point-to-point communication to shared-medium LANs, multi-hop internetworking, and Internet-scale systems; and from the application layer down to the physical layer. Students build intuition from real network behavior, learn core protocol mechanisms and design trade-offs, and gain hands-on experience via programming and measurement-driven labs/projects using tools such as sockets, Wireshark/tcpdump, Mininet, and containerized environments (Python recommended; C as an advanced option).

The objective of the course is to enable students to develop a rigorous understanding of how networked systems are designed, implemented, and evaluated, and to acquire practical skills to build and diagnose networked applications and protocols across layers and at scale.

At the end of this course, each student should be able to:
- Explain the Internet’s layered architecture and key design principles (e.g., encapsulation, end-to-end reasoning) and apply them to analyze new systems.
- Implement client–server applications using socket programming, and reason about application-layer protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS and DNS.
- Describe and evaluate reliable data transfer mechanisms (ACKs, timeouts, retransmissions), and explain TCP’s reliability, flow control, and congestion control at a conceptual and algorithmic level.
- Perform IP addressing and subnetting, and explain packet forwarding, routing fundamentals, NAT, and ICMP in practical scenarios.
- Explain link-layer services and mechanisms including framing, error detection, Ethernet switching, ARP, and Wi-Fi medium access (CSMA/CA) at an operational level.
- Measure and interpret network performance (throughput, latency, loss, jitter), and use standard tools (e.g., ping, traceroute, iperf, Wireshark) to diagnose bottlenecks and failures.
- Describe foundational security mechanisms (TLS, certificates, authentication) and recognize common network threats (e.g., spoofing, MITM, DoS) and basic mitigations.

## Academic Integrity

- No tolerance on cheating!
	-All academic integrity violation cases will be reported to the department, school, and university, and recorded.
	-Fail the course on any homework assignment/lab, project, or exam even for fir st offense.
	-Team members are **equally responsible**.
	-Consult the Department and University Statements on Academic Integrity.
	-Group study/discussion is encouraged, but the submission must be your own work.
- Homeworks: Homework reports must be written up individually. Use of reference materials in the library or online is allowed, providedthat the homework explicitly cites the references used. Note that copying the solutions from online sources or the previous semester is still considered cheating even if you cite the sources.
- Programming assignments: Programming assignments can be done individually or in teams of up to 2 students. One submission per team, one grade per team. Engaging in discussions concerning concepts is permitted; however, sharing of source code is strictly prohibited. In instances where external resources have been consulted, such as online materials, the provided demonstration code, or Beej’s Socket Programming Guide, students must clearly annotate the relevant sections of their work with commentary, demarcating the beginning and termination of the referenced material. Importantly, under NO circumstances may students rely on the work of their peers, including but not limited to GitHub repositories or code submissions from previous academic terms. We reserve the right to make the ultimate determination regarding breaches of academic integrity policies.
- Students who do share their work with others are as responsible for academic dishonesty as the student receiving the material. Students are not to show work to other students, in class or outside the class. Students are responsible for the security of their work and should ensure that printed copies are not left in accessible places, and that file/directory permissions are set to be unreadable to others.
- Excuses such as “I was not sure” or “I did not know” will not be accepted. If you are not sure, ask the TAs and /or the instructor.
- Any student may withdraw their submission (homework, lab, projects) any time, no questions asked, BEFORE any AI violation is discovered.
