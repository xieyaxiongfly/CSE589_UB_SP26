course_name: CSE589 Modern Network Concepts
course_description: "This course introduces the principles and practice of computer\
  \ networking through a two-axis progression: from small, point-to-point communication\
  \ to shared-medium LANs, multi-hop internetworking, and Internet-scale systems;\
  \ and from the application layer down to the physical layer. Students build intuition\
  \ from real network behavior, learn core protocol mechanisms and design trade-offs,\
  \ and gain hands-on experience via programming and measurement-driven labs/projects\
  \ using tools such as sockets, Wireshark/tcpdump, Mininet, and containerized environments\
  \ (Python recommended; C as an advanced option).\r\n\r\nThe objective of the course\
  \ is to enable students to develop a rigorous understanding of how networked systems\
  \ are designed, implemented, and evaluated, and to acquire practical skills to build\
  \ and diagnose networked applications and protocols across layers and at scale.\r\
  \n\r\nAt the end of this course, each student should be able to:\r\n\r\nExplain\
  \ the Internet’s layered architecture and key design principles (e.g., encapsulation,\
  \ end-to-end reasoning) and apply them to analyze new systems.\r\n\r\nImplement\
  \ client–server applications using socket programming, and reason about application-layer\
  \ protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS and DNS.\r\n\r\nDescribe and evaluate reliable data\
  \ transfer mechanisms (ACKs, timeouts, retransmissions), and explain TCP’s reliability,\
  \ flow control, and congestion control at a conceptual and algorithmic level.\r\n\
  \r\nPerform IP addressing and subnetting, and explain packet forwarding, routing\
  \ fundamentals, NAT, and ICMP in practical scenarios.\r\n\r\nExplain link-layer\
  \ services and mechanisms including framing, error detection, Ethernet switching,\
  \ ARP, and Wi-Fi medium access (CSMA/CA) at an operational level.\r\n\r\nMeasure\
  \ and interpret network performance (throughput, latency, loss, jitter), and use\
  \ standard tools (e.g., ping, traceroute, iperf, Wireshark) to diagnose bottlenecks\
  \ and failures.\r\n\r\nDescribe foundational security mechanisms (TLS, certificates,\
  \ authentication) and recognize common network threats (e.g., spoofing, MITM, DoS)\
  \ and basic mitigations."
