intro: "Programming, like composition, is an individual creative process. Individuals\
  \ must reach their own understanding of the problem and discover a path to its solution.\
  \ During this time, discussions with friends are encouraged. However, when the time\
  \ comes to write the code that solves the problem, such discussions are no longer\
  \ appropriate; the program must be your/ or your team's work.\r\n\r\nDo not, under\
  \ any circumstances, copy or adapt a program, code comments, or other source that\
  \ is not your own individual, unassisted programming work. This includes character-by-character\
  \ transliteration of another work (whether inspected visually or copied digitally),\
  \ but it also includes derivative works (i.e., by renaming variable names or subtlely\
  \ shifting around statements in order to try to hide that copying has occurrred).\
  \ You may not make use of ChatGPT or other AI composition software. You are also\
  \ not allowed to use code, comments, or results that are not your own, even when\
  \ \"citing\" them. Writing code for use by another or using another's code in any\
  \ form is academic misconduct and will be referred to the University in accordance\
  \ with the University's academic regulations. You are responsible for ensuring that\
  \ the code you write for the assignments is not accessible by others.\r\n\r\n##\
  \ Coding Style\r\nAll of the code you turn in for this course should have good style.\
  \ Make sure that your code has proper indentation, descriptive comments, and a comment\
  \ header at the beginning of each file, which includes your name, userid, and a\
  \ description of the file.\r\n\r\n## Version Control\r\nBecause accidents can happen\
  \ and it is good practice, we require you to use a version control system to maintain\
  \ your code for this course. We ask that you setup an account with github, gitlab,\
  \ or bitbucket, web-based hosting service for projects that use the git revision\
  \ control system.\r\n\r\n**You must configure these services to use a private code\
  \ repository. Do NOT under any circumstances make your code public, including after\
  \ the course is over.**\r\n\r\n## The assignment details"
assignments:
- title: TCP Client–Server Messaging
  link: ''
  description: Build a TCP client and server where the client streams arbitrary‑length
    input to the server, and the server accepts connections in a loop, prints received
    messages, and keeps serving new clients. The focus is on reliable transmission
    (chunked I/O and partial‑send handling), robust error management, and scripted
    verification with short, long, and concurrent message tests.
- title: Reliable Data Transfer over Unreliable Networks
  link: ''
  description: Implement a reliable transport layer for file delivery between a sender
    and receiver that preserves data integrity and ordering over lossy, delayed, and
    reordered packet networks. Your implementation should handle sequencing, acknowledgments,
    retransmissions, timeouts, and clean connection termination to complete transfers
    correctly under adverse network conditions. An emulator is provided to simulate
    network behaviors such as packet loss, delay, and reordering during validation.
